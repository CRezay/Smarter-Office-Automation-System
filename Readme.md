This is our code submission for the NVIDIA JETSON TX2 CHALLENGE where we present our project of SMART OFFICE AUTOMATION.
Here are the components of the product:
### 1)Face Recognition Based Attendance System
### 2)Person Tracking Based Office  Automation
### 3)Inventory Management System
### 4)Crowd Sensing And Management
